## Database Creation Instructions

### Complete Database Setup from Scratch

Follow these steps to recreate the entire Goldenberry Flow Knowledge Graph in Neo4j:

#### Prerequisites
- Neo4j Database (local or cloud instance)
- Neo4j Browser or compatible Cypher client
- APOC procedures plugin installed and enabled

#### Step 1: Database Preparation
```cypher
// Clear existing data (CAUTION: This deletes everything!)
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;

// Verify database is empty
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as NodeCount;
// Expected result: NodeCount = 0
```

#### Step 2: Create Constraints and Indexes
```cypher
// Create constraints for data integrity
CREATE CONSTRAINT business_model_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (bm:BusinessModel) REQUIRE bm.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT value_proposition_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (vp:ValueProposition) REQUIRE vp.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT customer_segment_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (cs:CustomerSegment) REQUIRE cs.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT revenue_stream_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (rs:RevenueStream) REQUIRE rs.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT product_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Product) REQUIRE p.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT volume_data_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (vd:VolumeData) REQUIRE vd.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT price_data_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (pd:PriceData) REQUIRE pd.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT time_period_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (tp:TimePeriod) REQUIRE tp.id IS UNIQUE;

// Create performance indexes
CREATE INDEX volume_data_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (vd:VolumeData) ON (vd.id);
CREATE INDEX price_data_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (pd:PriceData) ON (pd.id);
CREATE INDEX time_period_year_month IF NOT EXISTS FOR (tp:TimePeriod) ON (tp.year, tp.month);
CREATE INDEX product_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (p:Product) ON (p.name);
```

#### Step 3: Load Complete Business Model
Execute the complete business model creation script:
```bash
# Load main business model with JTBD integration
cat goldenberry_complete_model.cypher | neo4j-shell -c
```
**OR** in Neo4j Browser, copy and paste the entire contents of `goldenberry_complete_model.cypher`

#### Step 4: Load Time-Series Revenue Data
Execute the complete 13-month real data integration:
```bash
# Load all time-series data with real Excel values
cat complete_12month_real_data.cypher | neo4j-shell -c
```
**OR** in Neo4j Browser, copy and paste the entire contents of `complete_12month_real_data.cypher`

#### Step 5: Validation Queries
Run these essential validation checks:

**A. Verify Node Counts:**
```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n)[0] as NodeType, count(n) as Count
ORDER BY NodeType;

// Expected Results:
// BusinessModel: 1, Channel: 28, CostStructure: 33, CustomerRelationship: 2
// CustomerSegment: 2, JobExecutor: 2, JobToBeDone: 2, KeyActivity: 6
// KeyPartnership: 5, KeyResource: 5, PriceData: 39, Product: 3
// RevenueStream: 3, TimePeriod: 13, ValueProposition: 2, VolumeData: 39
```

**B. Validate Revenue Calculations:**
```cypher
MATCH (vd:VolumeData)-[:VOLUME_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p:Product)
WITH p.name as Product, SUM(vd.volume) as TotalVolume, p.baseUnitPrice as Price
RETURN
    Product,
    TotalVolume as TotalVolumeKg,
    Price as PricePerKg,
    ROUND(TotalVolume * Price, 2) as TotalRevenueUSD
ORDER BY TotalRevenueUSD DESC;

// Expected Results:
// Pitahaya: 184,503.9 kg × $6.63/kg = $1,223,260.86
// Goldenberries: 147,587.67 kg × $7.00/kg = $1,033,113.69
// Exotic Fruits: 16,500.0 kg × $5.00/kg = $82,500.00
// TOTAL REVENUE: $2,338,874.55
```

**C. Verify JTBD Integration:**
```cypher
MATCH (cs:CustomerSegment)-[:DEFINED_BY_JOB]->(je:JobExecutor)-[:EXECUTES_JOB]->(jtbd:JobToBeDone)
RETURN cs.name as CustomerSegment, je.name as JobExecutor, jtbd.name as JobToBeDone;

// Expected: 2 customer segments with complete JTBD mapping
```

**D. Check Time-Series Data Integrity:**
```cypher
MATCH (tp:TimePeriod)
RETURN count(tp) as TotalMonthlyPeriods,
       min(tp.year) as StartYear, max(tp.year) as EndYear;
// Expected: 13 monthly periods from 2024 to 2025
```

**E. Validate Relationship Counts (CRITICAL):**
```cypher
MATCH (tp:TimePeriod)-[r1]-(vd:VolumeData)
MATCH (tp:TimePeriod)-[r2]-(pd:PriceData)
RETURN
    count(r1) as VolumeDataRelationships,
    count(r2) as PriceDataRelationships,
    count(r1) + count(r2) as TotalTimeSeriesRelationships;
// Expected: 39 VolumeData + 39 PriceData = 78 Total Relationships
```

**F. Verify Each TimePeriod Has Exactly 3 Connections:**
```cypher
MATCH (tp:TimePeriod)<-[:OCCURS_IN_PERIOD]-(vd:VolumeData)
WITH tp, count(vd) as VolumeCount
WHERE VolumeCount != 3
RETURN tp.id as ProblematicTimePeriod, VolumeCount;
// Expected: No results (each TimePeriod should connect to exactly 3 VolumeData nodes)
```

#### Step 6: Run Comprehensive Validation
Execute all validation queries from `validation_queries.cypher`:
```bash
# Run complete validation suite
cat validation_queries.cypher | neo4j-shell -c
```

#### Step 7: Test Competency Questions
Execute sample queries from `competency_questions.md` to verify AI agent compatibility:

**Sample Test Query:**
```cypher
// Test fixed pricing model validation
MATCH (pd:PriceData)-[:PRICE_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p:Product {name: "Goldenberries (Physalis)"})
RETURN DISTINCT pd.price as Price, count(pd) as PriceDataNodes;
// Expected: Single price of $7.00 across all 13 months
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
1. **Constraint Violations**: Ensure database is empty before Step 2
2. **Memory Issues**: Load data in smaller batches for large datasets
3. **Relationship Multiplication**: NEVER use bulk queries with multiple products - create relationships by individual product to prevent Cartesian products
4. **Relationship Errors**: Verify all referenced nodes exist before creating relationships
5. **APOC Missing**: Install APOC plugin for advanced validation queries

**⚠️ WARNING: Avoid Bulk Relationship Queries**
```cypher
// ❌ DANGEROUS: Creates Cartesian products
MATCH (rs:RevenueStream), (vd:VolumeData), (pd:PriceData), (tp:TimePeriod)
WHERE [complex OR conditions...]
MERGE (vd)-[:OCCURS_IN_PERIOD]->(tp);

// ✅ SAFE: Process by individual product
MATCH (vd:VolumeData), (tp:TimePeriod)
WHERE vd.id CONTAINS 'goldenberries' AND RIGHT(vd.id, 7) = RIGHT(tp.id, 7)
MERGE (vd)-[:OCCURS_IN_PERIOD]->(tp);
```

**Data Verification Commands:**
```cypher
// Count total relationships
MATCH ()-[r]-() RETURN count(r) as TotalRelationships;

// Verify no orphaned nodes
MATCH (n) WHERE NOT (n)--() RETURN count(n) as OrphanedNodes;

// Check constraint compliance
CALL db.constraints();
```

### Success Criteria
✅ **Node Counts**: 12 business model node types + time-series data nodes
✅ **Revenue Validation**: $2,338,874.55 total annual revenue
✅ **Fixed Pricing**: Zero price volatility confirmed
✅ **Time Coverage**: 13-month fiscal year (Sep 2024 - Sep 2025)
