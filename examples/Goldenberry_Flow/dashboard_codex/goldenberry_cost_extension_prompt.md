## PHASE 1: Database Cost Query Methods

**Status:** Completed - cost query helpers added to `database/connection.py` and connection cleanup restored.

### Goal: Add cost data retrieval methods to Neo4jConnection class

### Modify file:
- database/connection.py

### Requirements:
1. Add method: `get_total_costs()` - returns sum of all costs
2. Add method: `get_variable_costs()` - returns sum of product-linked costs
3. Add method: `get_fixed_costs()` - returns sum of overhead costs
4. Add method: `get_cost_timeseries(product=None, category=None)` - monthly costs by category
5. Add method: `get_quarterly_costs(product=None, category=None)` - quarterly costs
6. Add method: `get_cost_categories()` - list of active cost structure names
7. Add method: `get_product_costs(product_name)` - costs for specific product
8. Add method: `get_average_cost_per_kg()` - weighted average across all products

### Cypher Query Patterns:
```cypher
// Total costs
MATCH (cd:CostData)
RETURN SUM(cd.amount) AS totalCosts

// Variable costs (product-linked)
MATCH (cd:CostData)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->()
RETURN SUM(cd.amount) AS variableCosts

// Fixed costs (no product link)
MATCH (cd:CostData)
WHERE NOT (cd)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->()
RETURN SUM(cd.amount) AS fixedCosts

// Monthly cost timeseries
MATCH (cd:CostData)-[:INCURRED_IN_PERIOD]->(tp:TimePeriod)
MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_STRUCTURE]->(cs:CostStructure)
OPTIONAL MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p:Product)
RETURN p.name AS product, cs.name AS category, 
       tp.year AS year, tp.month AS month, 
       SUM(cd.amount) AS cost
ORDER BY year, month
```

### Test before proceeding:
- All 8 methods return correct data types
- Queries execute without errors
- Product filtering works correctly
- Test with simple print statements in a test page
- Validated via `C:/Users/jprob/anaconda3/envs/base1/python.exe phase1_cost_methods_test.py` to exercise totals, filters, and `close_connection()`.

product_volume = get_product_volume(selected_product)
variable_cost = get_product_variable_costs(selected_product)

# Calculate metrics
cost_per_kg = variable_cost / product_volume
gross_profit = product_revenue - variable_cost
gross_margin = (gross_profit / product_revenue) * 100
profit_per_kg = gross_profit / product_volume
```

## Implementation Approach

Work through phases 1-15 sequentially. After completing each phase, test thoroughly before moving to the next. This ensures:
- Database layer is solid before building UI (Phase 1)
- New page works before enhancing existing pages (Phases 2-6)
- Product Performance extensions complete before Executive Dashboard (Phases 7-10)
- Executive Dashboard enhanced systematically (Phases 11-14)
- Final polish ensures production quality (Phase 15)

## Key Cypher Queries for Cost Data

### Monthly Cost Timeseries
```cypher
MATCH (cd:CostData)-[:INCURRED_IN_PERIOD]->(tp:TimePeriod)
MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_STRUCTURE]->(cs:CostStructure)
OPTIONAL MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p:Product)
WITH p.name AS product, cs.name AS category, 
     tp.year AS year, tp.month AS month,
     SUM(cd.amount) AS monthlyCost
RETURN product, category, year, month, monthlyCost
ORDER BY year, month, category
```

### Quarterly Cost Data
```cypher
MATCH (cd:CostData)-[:INCURRED_IN_PERIOD]->(tp:TimePeriod)
MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_STRUCTURE]->(cs:CostStructure)
OPTIONAL MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p:Product)
WITH p.name AS product, cs.name AS category,
     tp.year AS year, tp.quarter AS quarter,
     SUM(cd.amount) AS quarterlyCost
RETURN product, category, year, quarter, quarterlyCost
ORDER BY year, quarter, category
```

### Product Cost Breakdown
```cypher
MATCH (p:Product {name: $productName})
OPTIONAL MATCH (cd:CostData)-[:COST_FOR_PRODUCT]->(p)
OPTIONAL MATCH (cd)-[:COST_FOR_STRUCTURE]->(cs:CostStructure)
WITH cs.name AS category, SUM(cd.amount) AS cost
RETURN category, cost
ORDER BY cost DESC
```

## Technical Notes

### Blue Monochromatic Color Scheme
- **Critical**: Use ONLY blue color palette throughout entire dashboard
- Revenue visualizations: Light/medium blues (#0077B6, #00B4D8, #48CAE4)
- Cost visualizations: Dark/navy blues (#1E3A8A, #3730A3, #4338CA, #1E40AF)
- Profit metrics: Sky/cyan blues (#0EA5E9, #0284C7, #0369A1)
- Trend indicators: Bright blue (#60A5FA) for positive, dark blue (#1E40AF) for negative
- Background accents: Light blue (#DBEAFE) for highlighted sections

### Visual Distinction Strategy
- Use **saturation and brightness** to distinguish cost from revenue
- Darker, more saturated blues = costs
- Lighter, brighter blues = revenue
- Mid-tone blues = profitability metrics
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy through blue tones only

### Fixed Cost Allocation
- Allocate proportionally by revenue across all products
- Formula: `allocated_fixed = (product_revenue / total_revenue) * total_fixed_costs`
- Show allocation method in footnotes/captions
- Consistent across all pages

### Existing Component Reuse
- **Metric Cards**: Reuse exact pattern from executive_dashboard.py
- **Filters**: Reuse patterns from revenue_overview.py
- **Charts**: Match Plotly configuration from existing charts
- **Page Headers**: Use components.py render_page_header()
- **Empty States**: Use components.py render_empty_state()

### Known Issues to Avoid
- No HTML comments in st.markdown() blocks (Streamlit parser bug)
- Test with all three products to ensure calculations work
- Handle division by zero for products with no costs
- Ensure multiselect filters handle state correctly

## Data Validation

Before deploying, verify:
1. **Total Revenue** - **Total Costs** = **Net Profit** (should match across all pages)
2. Variable Costs + Fixed Costs = Total Costs
3. Gross Profit = Revenue - Variable Costs (per product)
4. Net Profit = Gross Profit - Allocated Fixed Costs (per product)
5. All percentages between 0-100%
6. No negative values where impossible
7. Costs allocated to products sum to variable costs
8. Sum of allocated fixed costs equals total fixed costs
