- Cycling Enthusiasts (performance focused)

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Business Model Canvas implementation in graph form
- Jobs-to-be-Done methodology integration
- Semantic knowledge enhancement techniques
- Strategic business analysis through graph queries
- Complete knowledge graph modeling approach

## Framework Benefits Demonstrated

### üéØ **Business Model Canvas Integration**
Each example shows how traditional Business Model Canvas components translate into interconnected graph structures, enabling dynamic analysis and strategic insights.

### üìã **Jobs-to-be-Done Methodology**
Examples demonstrate Clayton Christensen and Anthony Ulwick's JTBD theory integration, showing how customer jobs drive value proposition design and business model decisions.

### üìö **Semantic Enhancement**
All nodes contain research-based semantic descriptions from authoritative business literature, creating educational value alongside practical modeling.

### üîç **Strategic Analysis**
Comprehensive query sets enable deep business analysis including:
- Customer journey mapping
- Resource optimization analysis
- Cost driver identification
- Revenue stream assessment
- Partnership value evaluation

### üéì **Educational Value**
Examples serve as both practical tools and educational resources, teaching established business theory through hands-on implementation.

## Usage Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Neo4j Database (local or cloud instance)
- Basic understanding of Cypher query language
- Familiarity with Business Model Canvas concepts

### Getting Started
1. Choose an example directory
2. Review the README.md for business context
3. Run the complete model Cypher script
4. Use validation queries to verify implementation
5. Explore strategic analysis queries for insights

### Customization
Each example can be customized by:
- Modifying node properties to match your business
- Adjusting cost amounts and revenue figures
- Adding or removing relationships based on your model
- Extending with additional customer segments or value propositions

## Contributing Examples

We welcome additional business model examples that demonstrate the framework's capabilities. Good examples should:

- **Complete Implementation** - Include all 12 node types and core relationships
- **Real-world Relevance** - Model realistic business scenarios
- **Educational Value** - Provide learning opportunities for different industries
- **Documentation** - Include comprehensive README and query examples
- **Semantic Enhancement** - Incorporate research-based business theory

### Example Categories Needed
- **Technology Startups** - SaaS, mobile apps, platforms
- **Service Businesses** - Consulting, healthcare, education
- **Manufacturing** - Traditional and modern manufacturing models
- **Retail** - E-commerce, omnichannel, specialty retail
- **Non-Profit** - Social enterprises and mission-driven organizations

## Framework Evolution

These examples help drive framework development by:
- Testing completeness of node and relationship types
- Validating semantic enhancement approaches
- Identifying common business model patterns
- Demonstrating practical query patterns for analysis
- Providing feedback on framework usability

## Academic Foundation

All examples are grounded in established business theory:
- **Alexander Osterwalder & Yves Pigneur**: Business Model Generation (2010)
- **Clayton Christensen**: Jobs-to-be-Done Theory (Harvard Business School)
- **Anthony Ulwick**: Outcome-Driven Innovation (Strategyn)
- **Harvard Business Review**: Peer-reviewed business model research

## Next Steps

After exploring examples:
1. Use the [templates](../templates/) to create your own business model
2. Reference the [core schema](../core/) for technical implementation details
3. Explore [Mermaid visualizations](../mermaid/) for graph representation
4. Build upon examples to model your specific business context

These examples demonstrate that business modeling can be both theoretically grounded and practically actionable through knowledge graph approaches.
